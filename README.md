# Buzzvel Front-End Test 2024
This is my solution to the Front-End Development technical test sent me by Buzzvel. This project was developed in August 2024 using ReactJS, Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

The project uses CSS styles and animations extensively, aiming to make the user experience as pleasant as possible.

Clone and install the dependencies using **_npm install_**.

## Scripts
### npm start
Starts the project and the local server. After compilation is finished, it can be accessed at localhost:3000.
### npm run build
Builds the project for production. The project will be output to the **_build_** folder.
